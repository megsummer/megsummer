## Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Megan and new to the tech world. I've worked professionally with data for the last 8 years to gain insights around customer behavior, preferences, and trends. I loved creating customer stories and working collaboratively but I felt I could delve deeper into my expertise and stretch my skills, leading me to pursue learning Java, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and SQL.

I have hands-on collaborative experience working with Java, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, SQL, and Vue.js.
